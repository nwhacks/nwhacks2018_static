      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
      nwHacks (Northwest Hacks) is an annual hackathon held at the University of British Columbia, shaping up to be the premier community event for young hackers and engineers in the Pacific Northwest Region - including both the US and
      Canada. Our event will host some of the best up-and-coming engineers and developers from across the continent and beyond to
      create mobile, web, and hardware hacks for 24 hours. Bringing in students from around the region, nwHacks is
      committed to encouraging and kickstarting a culture of innovation, entrepreneurship, and community among
      future hackers of the region. We seek to keep innovation in the area through the hackathon and by providing a
      welcoming, supportive environment to allow everyone to realize their dreams and develop their skills.
      </p>

      <h2>When &#38; Where</h2>
      <p>
      nwHacks is scheduled to take place in Spring 2018 on the University of British Columbia campus. We are expecting 600 students to attend our event from multiple universities across North America.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Sponsor</h2>
      <p>
      With untapped talent from Seattle, Vancouver, and beyond, nwHacks has huge potential for companies looking to recruit the top talent from the top schools. Compared to traditional recruitment strategies, sponsoring a hackathon represents a high-value and low-cost way to secure talent for your company. Many companies have found some of their best employees through hackathons. Hackathons also provide sponsors the opportunity to get real feedback on their products by developers who use them. Sponsors can demo their API in front of participants, generating publicity for themselves and growing developer awareness of their products and services.

      </p>
      <h3>Send Engineers</h3>
      <p>
      Sending engineers is a surefire way to connect hackers with your company. Sending technical employees to explain what they do and how their product works is sure get the attention of the best hackers at nwHacks. This is a great way for you to connect with your audience and increase your recruitment/promotion potential!
      </p>
      <h3>Bring your API or Product</h3>
      <p>
